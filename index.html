  <h1>About</h1>

<p>
  My name is Isaac Williams, and I'm a writer with a background in technology and data science.
  In my current role as the Data Visualization Librarian at the
  <a href="https://libraries.uta.edu/">University of Texas at Arlington</a>, I teach data science
  skills to students through in-person workshops and online educational content. Before that, I received
  an MLIS and a BA (in English) from UCLA. In graduate school, I worked at the
    <a href="https://digital.library.ucla.edu/">UCLA
    Digital Library Program</a> and the <a href="http://www.politicalgraphics.org/">Center for the Study
    of Political Graphics</a>, where I worked on digital projects and wrote technical documentation.
  I'm invested in making technology accesible, which led me to become a certified instructor with
  <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">The Carpentries</a> in 2019.

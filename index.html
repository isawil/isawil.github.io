<p>
  My name is Isaac Williams, and I'm the Data Visualization Librarian at the
    <a href="https://libraries.uta.edu/">University of Texas at Arlington</a>.
    I teach students and faculty how to use data visualization and digital humanities tools and methods,
    including GIS, Tableau, data cleaning, text analysis, and more, with an emphasis on critical data literacy.
    I'm invested in making digital research accessible to students from a variety of disciplines,
    which is partially what led me to become a certified instructor with
    <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">The Carpentries</a> in 2019.
  </p>

<p>
  I have published and presented within both "ends" of the digital humanities. Most recently,
  I presented a poster session at the Research Data Access and Preservation 2020 Summit on the topic
  of collaborations between data librarians and archivists. My poetry is forthcoming in Colorado Review,
  and I have been accepted to workshops in poetry by Tin House and the Kenyon Review.
</p>

  <p>
    Before my current role, I received an MLIS and a BA (in English) from UCLA. I was also a student
    at Riverside Community College in Riverside, California. In graduate school, I worked at the
    <a href="https://digital.library.ucla.edu/">UCLA
    Digital Library Program</a> and the <a href="http://www.politicalgraphics.org/">Center for the Study
    of Political Graphics</a>, as well as teaching undergraduate students and managing digital archives
    at the UCLA History Department.

  <h1>About</h1>

<p>
  My name is Isaac Williams, and I'm the Data Visualization Librarian at the
  <a href="https://libraries.uta.edu/">University of Texas at Arlington</a>.
  I teach students and faculty how to use data visualization and digital humanities tools and methods,
  including Tableau, data cleaning, text analysis, and more, with an emphasis on critical data literacy.
  I'm invested in making digital research accessible to students from non-STEM
  backgrounds, which is partially what led me to become a certified instructor with
  <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">The Carpentries</a> in 2019.
</p>

<p>
  Before my current role, I received an MLIS and a BA (in English) from UCLA. I was also a student
  at Riverside Community College in Riverside, California. In graduate school, I worked at the
  <a href="https://digital.library.ucla.edu/">UCLA
  Digital Library Program</a> and the <a href="http://www.politicalgraphics.org/">Center for the Study
  of Political Graphics</a>, as well as teaching undergraduate students and managing digital archives
  at the UCLA History Department.
</p>

<p>
  The last book I read was "Severance" by Ling Ma.

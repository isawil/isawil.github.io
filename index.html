  <h1>About</h1>

<p>
  My name is Isaac Williams, and I'm the Data Visualization Librarian at the
  <a href="https://libraries.uta.edu/">University of Texas at Arlington</a>.
  I teach students and faculty how to use data visualization and digital humanities tools and methods,
  including Tableau, OpenRefine, Microsoft Excel, and more. I've taught students in a variety of disciplines,
  from English to Marketing. I'm invested in making digital research accessible to students from non-STEM
  backgrounds, which is partially what led me to become a certified instructor with
  <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">The Carpentries</a> in 2019.
</p>

<p>
  Before my current role, I received an MLIS and a BA (in English) from UCLA. I was also a student
  at Riverside Community College in Riverside, California. In graduate school, I worked at the
  <a href="https://digital.library.ucla.edu/">UCLA
  Digital Library Program</a> and the <a href="http://www.politicalgraphics.org/">Center for the Study
  of Political Graphics</a>, as well as teaching undergraduate students and managing digital archives
  at the UCLA History Department.

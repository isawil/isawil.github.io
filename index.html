  <h1>About</h1>

<p>
  My name is Isaac Williams, and I'm the Data Visualization Librarian at the University of Texas at Arlington.
  I teach students and faculty how to use data visualization and digital humanities tools and methods,
  including Tableau, OpenRefine, Microsoft Excel, and more. I've taught students in a variety of disciplines,
  from English to Marketing. I'm invested in making digital research accessible to students from non-STEM
  backgrounds, which is partially what led me to become a certified Instructor with The Carpentries.

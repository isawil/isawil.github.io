## Dallas Death Map Project

A collaboration between myself and Priscilla Escobedo, this map aims to visualize death in Dallas from 1915-1920, and is a work in progress. The map was created using data culled from archival sources at the Dallas Public Library, and documents deaths that occurred outside hospitals and other places where death might be "expected." We are currently seeking to expand the project.

## Mapping MTA Growth Over Time

I wanted to see if the City of New York is investing in transit infrastructure in transit deserts in the city, so I made an animated map using an adapted dataset from the City (I adapted it by including when stations were built).

This is an early project of mine that still gets attention: a map of rat sightings in New York City, also created using city data. In 2020, I am looking to create an expanded version--can you believe this is only a tiny fraction of all sightings reported?

This is a map showing where posters at the [Center for the Study of Political Graphics](https://wwww.politicalgraphics.org/) in Culver City, California originate from. It only shows locations for digitized posters.

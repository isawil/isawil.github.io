## Dallas Death Map Project

![The overview of the Dallas Death Map](https://github.com/isawil/isawil.github.io/blob/master/assets/ddm-2019-02.png)

A collaboration between myself and Priscilla Escobedo, this map aims to visualize death in Dallas from 1915-1920, and is a work in progress. The map was created using data culled from archival sources at the Dallas Public Library, and documents deaths that occurred outside hospitals and other places where death might be "expected." We are currently seeking to expand the project.

Some places my work has appeared or will soon appear are Colorado Review, [Rust + Moth](https://rustandmoth.com/work/hours-after-news-of-the-death/), [Assaracus](https://siblingrivalrypress.bigcartel.com/product/assaracus-issue-24-a-journal-of-gay-poetry), [Potluck Magazine](http://potluckmag.com/march-2016/2016/3/10/three-poems), Westwind, and more. I was previously a poetry reader for The Adroit Journal, a literary journal recognized by The New York Times, The Paris Review, NPR, and Teen Vogue. I contributed to the journal's [Best Books of 2016](https://theadroitjournal.org/2016/12/27/presenting-adroits-best-books-of-2016/) feature. I have also been accepted to workshops in poetry by Tin House and the Kenyon Review.

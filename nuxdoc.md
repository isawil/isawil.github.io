## Logging in

To get to Nuxeo, go to https://nuxeo.cdlib.org. From here, select UCLA as your campus and
login using shibboleth. Click on “Asset Library” and then “UCLA.” From the next menu, you can
select your subcategory (e.g., “Institute for Research on Labor and Employment” for IRLE), and
from the next menu, you can select the exact folder you want.

## Adding content
To add content, you can use the Nuxeo File Uploader, or you can upload assets directly to the
Nuxeo via your web browser. Instructions for the File Uploader are attached.

To add content from your web browser, navigate to the folder you would like to add content to. If
you need to create a folder, click the button to the top left of the menu that says “New,” and
select “Project folder.”

Inside your folder, click the “New” button and select the type of object you would like to add.

Adding metadata
From the next screen, you can add metadata for the object in the appropriate fields. You can
add your file to the record by uploading to “main content file” at the top of the page.
Editing metadata
You can edit collection-level metadata by navigating to the collection page and clicking on the
“Edit” tab at the top of the page.
You can edit item-level metadata by clicking on the item title. On the next page, you can edit
metadata by scrolling down to the metadata section and clicking the “edit” button.
There are a few ways to add or edit metadata in bulk. One way is to edit as a spreadsheet. You
can do this by clicking the “Spreadsheet” icon at the top right side of the collection in folder view.
Please note that only repeatable fields can be edited in spreadsheet view. You can change
fields visible in spreadsheet view by returning to the collection page and clicking the “edit result
columns” button and adding or removing fields.
